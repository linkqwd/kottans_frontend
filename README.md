### Task 0
- A lot new information about working with remote repository and merge conflicts.
- I was surprised by the lesson where I needed to look for a bug in code with "diff" command through console. Never thought that someone would try to find a bug in such way.
- Hope to use all my knowledges about git on practice, especially about merging branches to remote repository.

### Task 1
#### 1. Linux Command Line Basics
- Not much new information about command line, mostly because I've already used to it, but there were couple minor useful things to me such as globbing.

#### 2. Configuring Linux Web Servers
-	It was useful to refresh knowledge about linux filesystem, ownerships, $path variable and how SSH works.
- Some tips about security and firewall were helpful, which I will use in future.

 #### 3. Networking for Web Developers
- I learned more about how networks work, internet addresses, network protocols and ports, it was fun to mess with "netcat" application and make requests manually, then it became even more fun to watch how queries go and study them through tcpdump application.
- Interesting course, but seems more interesting than useful. I still don't really understand how to apply some information from the course in real tasks, I would say it was too theoretical.

 #### Articles
- Nice conclusion articles after networking course, it seems important to know about URLs, request verbs and status codes.
- Request headers looks very intricate, hope I will get used to them, also in the first article was information how to use Http in Web frameworks and libraries, looking forward to try these too.
- Google developer tool to view Http traffic is rock!
- Second article about connections, authentication and caching was interesting too, i think i will find it useful in future.

### Task 2
#### 1. What is Version Control
- I studied many cool features about working with local repository, for example some flags for log command (--oneline is really handy) and other approaches which help to track changes in repository and undo some of them.
- I was surprised by backup trick, when backup just goes as branch from HEAD and then can be easily recovered if something goes wrong with un-doing commits or even rebasing. Think I will use it in future.

#### 2. GitHub & Collaboration
- In this course i mostly repeated knowledge which was studied before in task_0, but this course is more complete and cover more details, also i understood how to manually add remotes and fetch new data from them. 
- Rebase command seems surprising, I've successfully destroyed my repository while I was playing with that.
- I surely won't rebase those commits which are already commited (pushed) into remote repository.

### Task 3
#### Intro to HTML & CSS
- Pretty basic course, I refreshed my knowledge about working with fonts and Chrome dev tools.
- Picked up couple little things from extra materials, for example github pages.

### Task 4
#### Responsive Web Design Fundamentals
- I learned useful approaches about making responsive markup, flex boxes and media queries were quite intresting, also it was useful to practice making responsive page.
- I was surprised by calculating CSS pixels, that there is difference between CSS and hardware pixels.
- Extra materials were great, especially I liked "Flexbox Froggy", it helped me to remember how flex-boxes work.
