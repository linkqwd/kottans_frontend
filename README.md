### Task 0 ( 2018 update )
- I thought I knew git basics, but actually i studied some new concepts how to use git and how it's work. Also refreshed my knowledge from previous year.
- Lesson where was needed to search for a bug in code with "diff" command via console. Never thought that someone would try to find a bug in such way, though it's pretty convenient.
- Besides all other commands, git show, credential.helper wincred, git fetch, git diff will be useful for me as well as refreshed knowledge of basics.

### Task 1
#### 0. Learn the Command Line
- Mostly, I have already known concepts from this course, but some of them I could barely remembered and course helped me to refresh and structurise my knowledge. Even though I was familiar with it I was surprised by things i could do with  environmental variables.

#### 1. Linux Command Line Basics
- Not much new information about command line, but there were couple useful things such as globbing.

#### 2. Configuring Linux Web Servers
-	It was useful to refresh knowledge about linux filesystem, ownerships, $path variable and how SSH works.
- Some tips about security and firewall were helpful, which I will use in future.

 #### 3. Networking for Web Developers
- I learned more about how networks work, internet addresses, network protocols and ports, it was fun to mess with "netcat" utility and make requests manually, then it became even more fun to watch how queries proceed and study them through tcpdump utility.
- Interesting course, but seems more interesting than useful. I still don't really understand how to apply  information from ершы course in real tasks, I would say it was too theoretical.

 #### Articles
- Nice conclusion articles after networking course, it seems important to know about URLs, request verbs and status codes.
- Request headers looks very intricate, hope I will get used to them, also in the first article was information how to live with Http porocol in Web frameworks and libraries, looking forward to try these too.
- Google developer tool to view Http traffic is rock!
- Second article about connections, authentication and caching was interesting too, i think i will find it useful in future. 

----------

### Task 2
#### 1. What is Version Control
- I studied many cool features about working with local repository, for example some flags for log command (--oneline is really handy) and other approaches which help to track changes in repository and undo some of them.
- I was surprised by backup trick, when backup just goes as branch from HEAD and then can be easily recovered if something goes wrong with un-doing commits or even rebasing. Think I will use it in future.

#### 2. GitHub & Collaboration
- In this course i mostly repeated knowledge which was studied before in task_0, but this course is more complete and cover more details, also i understood how to manually add remotes and fetch new data from them. 
- Rebase command seems surprising, I've successfully destroyed my repository while I was playing with that.
- I surely won't rebase those commits which are already commited (pushed) into remote repository.

### Task 3
#### Intro to HTML & CSS
- Pretty basic course, I refreshed my knowledge about working with fonts and Chrome dev tools.
- Picked up couple little things from extra materials, for example github pages.

----------

### Task 4
#### Responsive Web Design Fundamentals
- I learned useful approaches about making responsive markup, flex boxes and media queries were quite intresting, also it was useful to practice making responsive page.
- I was surprised by calculating CSS pixels, that there is difference between CSS and hardware pixels.
- Extra materials were great, especially I liked "Flexbox Froggy", it helped me to remember how flex-boxes work.

----------

### Task 5
#### Intro to JS
- I've studied Js before, but just a little bit, so some parts of the course were new to me. There were things that I didn't know, mostly about methods which can be applied to arrays, for example forEach() or map(), and I also learned other basic but "less common" things (as i would call it) about objects and functions, that there is "scope" and it is possible to write your own methods for objects, etc...
- I was surprised by "equality" in Js, that "true > 0" will return "true". During this course, it seemd to me that "loosely typed language" isnt a good thing.
- All information from this course will be useful, it's also important to keep practising.
