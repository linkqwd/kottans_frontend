### Task 0: Git and GitHub
- I thought I knew git basics, but actually I studied some new concepts how to use git and how it works. Also refreshed my knowledge from previous year.
- Lesson where was needed to search for a bug in code with "diff" command via console. Never thought that someone would try to find a bug in such way, though it's pretty convenient.
- Besides all other commands, git show, credential.helper wincred, git fetch, git diff will be useful for me as well as refreshed knowledge of basics.

### Task 1: Linux CLI, and HTTP
#### 0. Learn the Command Line
- Mostly, I have already known concepts from this course, but some of them I could barely remembered and course helped me to refresh and structurise my knowledge. Even though I was familiar with it I was surprised by things i could do with environmental variables.

#### 1. Linux Command Line Basics
- Not much new information about command line, but there were couple useful things such as globbing.

#### 2. Configuring Linux Web Servers
-	It was useful to refresh knowledge about linux filesystem, ownerships, $path variable and how SSH works.
- Some tips about security and firewall were helpful, which I will use in future.

#### 3. Networking for Web Developers
- I learned more about how networks work, internet addresses, network protocols and ports, it was fun to mess with "netcat" utility and make requests manually, then it became even more fun to watch how queries proceed and study them through tcpdump utility.
- Interesting course, but seems more interesting than useful. I still don't really understand how to apply  information from ершы course in real tasks, I would say it was too theoretical.

#### Articles
- Nice conclusion articles after networking course, it seems important to know about URLs, request verbs and status codes.
- Request headers looks very intricate, hope I will get used to them, also in the first article was information how to live with Http porocol in Web frameworks and libraries, looking forward to try these too.
- Google developer tool to view Http traffic is rock!
- Second article about connections, authentication and caching was interesting too, i think i will find it useful in future.

### Task 2: Git Collaboration
#### 1. What is Version Control
- Flags for git log command (--oneline, -p, -stat are pretty handy), Relative Commit References & Ancestry References and other approaches which help to track changes in repository and undo some of them.
- I was surprised by backup trick and how simple it is, when backup just goes as branch from HEAD and then can be easily recovered if something goes wrong with reseting commits or even rebasing. Think I will use it in future.

#### 2. GitHub & Collaboration
- In this course I mostly repeated information which studied before in previous tasks, but this course revealed and covered more details, also there were new things about fetching\pulling data and how to manually add remote paths to repos and work with them. 
- Still, rebase command surprises, I don't used to it but feel like it will be useful in some cases in future. For example, when all branch commits can be squashed into one and beutifully merged into master, without creating mess in commits history of the master branch.

### Task 4: Responsive Web Design
#### Responsive Web Design Fundamentals
- Just repeated concepts of responsive layout.
- Calculating difference between CSS pixels and Hardware pixels still surprises.

### Task 5: JS Basics
#### Intro to JS
- I've studied js before for a while but there were some things that were useful to refresh in memory.
- Type conversion in javaScript still surprises me.
- All information from this course will be useful, it's also important to keep practising.

#### freecodecamp Algorithm Scripting Challenges
- Interesting challenges, some of them took me a long time to think over. The most complicated for me was *Wherefore art thou* but I was glad that I solved this piece of ~~shit~~ code.

----------

### Task: 6: DOM
#### JavaScript and the DOM 
- There was just enough information about basics of DOM manipulation, so course stayed simple and helpful to get glance on basics and grasp it effectively. I've heeard before about things whiche were explained in this course, but this time i finally structurize my knowledge so I can use those tools now.
- I was surprised by optimization tricks and how to use .setTimeout to make a code work faster. Definitely I will try out it in future.
- All the methods from this course will be used in future. There is no way to avoid that, i guess.

#### freecodecamp Algorithm Scripting Challenges
- Still challenging but went easier than previous ten.
- Most interesting were: the one in which I had to write methods for bob object, the one about converting binary numbers into words, and the one about closures (double function invoke)
