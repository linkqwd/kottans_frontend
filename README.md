#### Task 0
- A lot new information about working with remote repository and merge conflicts.
- I was surprised by the lesson where you i needed to look for a bug in code with "diff" command through console. Never thought that someone would try to find a bug in such way.
- Hope to use all my knowledges about git on practice, especially about merging branches to remote repository.
