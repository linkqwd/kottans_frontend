#### Task 0
- A lot new information about working with remote repository and merge conflicts.
- I was surprised by the lesson where I needed to look for a bug in code with "diff" command through console. Never thought that someone would try to find a bug in such way.
- Hope to use all my knowledges about git on practice, especially about merging branches to remote repository.

#### Task 1
1. Linux Command Line Basics
- Not much new information about command line, mostly because I've already used to it, but there were couple minor useful things to me such as globbing.
