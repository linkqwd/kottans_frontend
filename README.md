#### Task 0
- A lot new information about working with remote repository and merge conflicts.
- I was surprised by the lesson where I needed to look for a bug in code with "diff" command through console. Never thought that someone would try to find a bug in such way.
- Hope to use all my knowledges about git on practice, especially about merging branches to remote repository.

#### Task 1
1. Linux Command Line Basics
- Not much new information about command line, mostly because I've already used to it, but there were couple minor useful things to me such as globbing.

2. Configuring Linux Web Servers
-	It was useful to refresh knowledge about linux filesystem, ownerships, $path variable and how SSH works.
- Some tips about security and firewall were helpful, which I will use in future.

 3. Networking for Web Developers
- I learned more about how networks work, internet addresses, network protocols and ports, it was fun to mess with "netcat" application and make requests manually, then it became even more fun to watch how queries go and study them through tcpdump application.
 - Interesting course, but seems more interesting than useful. I still don't really understand how to apply some information in real tasks, some information was too theoretical.
